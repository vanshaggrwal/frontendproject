    <h1>Importance of SPF for man...<br><br></h1><center><h1>

    <p>While most Indian men are not afraid of the scorching summer heat, studies show multiple reasons to avoid direct exposure to the sun. Sweating and tanning may seem like minor problems that can be treated but issues like sunburn, skin cancer and premature skin ageing need precaution.<br>

        We cannot avoid the sun altogether. It boosts mental health and is a source of vitamin D.<br>
        
        However, stepping out in the hot summer, especially after a lockdown due to the pandemic, can be overwhelming for your body. Even though most men do not have a regular self-care routine, applying sunscreen or sunblock before stepping out has several benefits.<br><br>
        <OL><li>
         Protections against UV rays: because of the earth's rising temperature due to the depleting ozone layer, I think it's safe to agree it's too much heat out there. Sunscreen works as a protective layer and reduces the penetration of harmful UV rays. In turn, it reduces the chances of getting a sunburn.</li><br>
       <li>Even Skin tone: Regular application of sunscreen helps in preventing excess tanning or discolouration. It makes up for healthy, smooth skin.</li><br>
        <li> Prevents skin cancer and other long-term disorders: With consistent use of sunscreen, the skin remains hydrated and prevents skin disorders from happing in the future, which may sometimes take a decade or two show visible symptoms.</li><br>
        <li>Moisturizing the skin: Sunscreens can also double up as moisturizers for men that hydrates the skin and provides a supple look.</li><br></OL></p>
