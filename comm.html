    <h1>Common Summer skin Problems<br><br></h1><center><h1>

    <p>The hot and humid weather does not bear a good relation with healthy and glowing skin, instead invites many skin problems during summer. Here are a few common issues along with their solutions.<br><ol><h1></h1><li>Ace Breakouts</li></h1><p>The perspiration on your skin blends in with bacteria, oil and clogs the pores, prompting breakouts—those with oily and acne-prone skin experience much more flights during the hot and humid summer months.
<br>
       <b> Solution: </b>Always blot sweat from the skin with a clean towel or clean cloth. Using a cleanser with salicylic acid and non-comedogenic skincare and makeup products will counter excessive oil production, thereby helping clear out acne.</p><li> Dry and irritated skin</li><p>
       Despite the environment being hot and humid, the skin can still get dry and irritated. Dry skin is one of the most typical summer skin problems. Its primary source is excess skin exposure to the sun, pool water, and air conditioning for long spans.<br>
       
      <b> Solution:</b> Using a mild cleanser to wash skin, applying fragrance-free moisturizer after every shower and bath, and sunscreen before going outdoors, especially that offers broad-spectrum protection, SPF 30+, and water resistance, can turn out handy to treat and prevent dryness.
    </p>
   <li>Folliculitis</li><p>
    The opening on the skin from which a hair grows is known as a follicle. Whenever it gets tainted because of bacteria or dirt, you foster folliculitis. It seems like a pimple on the outer layer of the skin, yet delicate to the touch and itchy. It is a typical summer skin issue that can be easily treated. Wearing light-weight, loose-fitting clothes when it’s hot and humid are recommended.</p><li>Sun allergy</li><p>
        Being under the sun can develop hives or even itchy skin rashes. These rashes are triggered by the intake of certain medications like doxycycline and ketoprofen. Red and highly itchy bumps on some (or all) bare skin appear in case of sun allergy.
        <br><b>
        Solution:</b> Protecting your skin from the sun is the only way forward. You can seek shade, wear sun-protective clothes, and apply good protective sunscreen.</p></ol>
