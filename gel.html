    <h2>What is Gel Based Sunscreens?</h2>
    <p>Gel-based-sunscreens are lightweight and get absorbed into the skin quickly. The water-based formulation of gel sunscreen is non-sticky, non-greasy and easily absorbed into the skin. One of the best advantages of gel-based-sunscreen is that it does not create a white cast on the skin due to its water-based formulation.<Br>

Being lightweight, it quickly gets absorbed into the skin, making them ideal for use during outdoor physical activities or in humid weather.<br>Sunscreen gels are available in various SPF (SPF 50 sunscreen, which is most recommendable) levels, which indicate the level of protection against UVB rays that cause sunburn.<br>
        Experts recommend Sunscreen Gel for oily and acne-prone skin, as gel-based-sunscreens such as they are lightweight and non-sticky. Unlike other sunscreens, gel-based-sunscreens are non-comedogenic, which means they won't clog the skin's pores. Gel sunscreens are lightweight and absorb quickly into the skin, making them ideal for indoor and outdoor use.<br>Sunscreen should be a part of your morning skincare routine and choose a sunscreen with SPF 50 for protection against the UVA and UVB rays. Infact, the most crucial factor when choosing a sunscreen is to ensure that it has a sufficient SPF level for your skin type and activity level and to reapply it regularly throughout the day. It's also a good idea to choose a sunscreen labeled as "broad spectrum," meaning that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.<br>
        Whether sunscreen gel or cream is better for your skin depends on your skin type and personal preference. Both sunscreen gel and cream provide adequate protection against UV rays, but they differ in texture and feel.</p>
